Overview and Motivation \
The GYM Management System is aimed at helping both students and club members to Reserve Gym Slots ( Space and Time ) for various sports and other activities, and in the meantime helping admins to organize the GYM. If we take an example of the Gym at UNC Charlotte, there are sports clubs with fixed time slots and spaces assigned. However students who are not part of any clubs donâ€™t have any means to reserve or check availability of Gym. It works on a first come first serve basis. Many times students travel all the way to the gym, only to find that it is already occupied. This wastes a lot of their time as well as energy. Our System would let users check time slots at the gym for various activities, and also let them reserve/cancel time slots, rooms, lockers, equipment etc. Along with this, our system would also provide functions like Booking a tour of the Gym, Posting Announcements, Tracking, Setting Reminders etc.

Scope and Objectives \
We are basically using this software for reserving a spot or court at the gym at UNC Charlotte. We are planning to add three levels of users-\
1)Students - They can view which courts are free and book it online for a specific time.\
2)Club Members- We have different sports clubs such as badminton, table tennis , soccer etc. where they have problems communicating with the student. They can use this website to post announcements about their clubs and timings and place where they meet.\
3)Administrator- These are the users which actually work at the gym and where they can help new students by giving tours. They also have the duty of approving equipment for rental online and making sure students know when to return. They will also keep track of reserved slots, equipment etc. They may also post announcements to inform students of available slots.


The Core Objectives/Functions of this System would include-
1.	Reserving a Slot
2.	Searching for Slots
3.	Posting Announcements
4.	Requesting a Tour
5.	Renting and Tracking Equipment
6.	Maintaining User History
7.	Reserving Lockers
8.	Waitlisting for Reservation
9.	Sending Reminders

Primary back-end programming language
Python 3 is our choice for the implementation and we have setup PyCharm as our Integrated Development Environment. As our backend Database, we will be using a relational database framework such as MySQL.

Used Twilio API for sending reminders to users through sms.
